# Password-Generator
### 03-JavaScript-Challenge-02
----
    This application provides a service to those employees who need a strong password randomly generated.  Simply click on the 'generate' button and you will be prompted the following boolean alerts:
----
* Would you like to have lowercase letters in your password?
* Would you like to have uppercase letters in your password?
* Would you like to have numbers (0-9) in your password?
* Would you like to have special characters in your password?  

<br>

### After completing these prompts, the application will ask you for:
* length of desired password
    * The user must enter a valid integer between __8 and 128__
    * Failure to input a valid integer will result in an error

<br>

    >In case of an error, simply click on the 'generate' button again and you may begin the process from the beginning without reloading the page!
----
Upon completion of these user prompts, the password will be generated and displayed in the textbox on screen.  This text can be easily copied and pasted.
